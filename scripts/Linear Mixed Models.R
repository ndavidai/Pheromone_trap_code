### Generalize Linear Mixed Models (LMM) ###

### Plot the data, lumping certain variables together
# allows for estimating slope and intercept parameters for each categorical predictor variable separately,
# uses all the data available (lumping) while accounting for pseudoreplication 
# accounts for structure in data (for example, stands nested in plots nested in forests);
# while allowing relationships to vary by different grouping factors (known as random effects);
# requires less parameter estimates than classical regression which saves degrees of freedom.

# Look at data structure
str(fish.data)

# Look at the distribution of samples for each factor
table(fish.data[ , c("Lake", "Fish_Species")])

# Look at the distribution of continuous variables:
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(4, 4, 1, 1))
hist(fish.data$Fish_Length, xlab = "Length (mm)", main = "")
hist(fish.data$Trophic_Pos, xlab = "Trophic position", main = "")

plot(fish.data)
cor(Fish_Length,Trophic_Pos)

## Challenge 3:
# Use a Z-correction to see if the data have very different scales of variation, based on species or lake
# this 'standardizes' the scales of variation

# Standardized fish length, with the function scale
fish.data$Z_Length <- (fish.data$Fish_Length - mean(fish.data$Fish_Length)) / 
  sd(fish.data$Fish_Length)

# Standardized trophic position, with the function scale
fish.data$Z_TP     <- scale(fish.data$Trophic_Pos)


lm.test <- lm(Z_TP ~ Z_Length, data = fish.data)

lm.test.resid <- rstandard(lm.test)
