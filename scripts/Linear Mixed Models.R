### Generalize Linear Mixed Models (LMM) ###

### Plot the data, lumping certain variables together
# allows for estimating slope and intercept parameters for each categorical predictor variable separately,
# uses all the data available (lumping) while accounting for pseudoreplication 
# accounts for structure in data (for example, stands nested in plots nested in forests);
# while allowing relationships to vary by different grouping factors (known as random effects);
# requires less parameter estimates than classical regression which saves degrees of freedom.
